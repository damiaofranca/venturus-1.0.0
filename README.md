## Project creation steps

### Create structures of project.
>  First of all, the project structure was created.
      
### Created necessary screens
>  Once the project structure was done, I started creating all the necessary screens to implement the data (dashboard, add screen, edit screen and delete modal).

### CRUD creation of the data
>  After I finished the screens, I started to implement the requests and data handling for creating the CRUD (starting successively with create, read, update, delete).
